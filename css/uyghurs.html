    <h2>Uyghurs</h2>

    <h4>Not to be confused with Yugur</h4>

    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

    <p>The Uyghurs[note 2] (/ˈwiːɡʊərz, -ɡərz/ WEE-goorz, -⁠gərz),[25] alternatively spelled Uighurs,[26] Uygurs or
        Uigurs, are a Turkic ethnic group originating from and culturally affiliated with the general region of Central
        and East Asia. The Uyghurs are recognized as native[note 3] to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in
        Northwest China. They are one of China's 55 officially recognized ethnic minorities.[27] The Uyghurs are
        recognized by the Chinese government as a regional minority and the titular people of Xinjiang.</p>

    <p>The Uyghurs have traditionally inhabited a series of oases scattered across the Taklamakan Desert within the
        Tarim Basin. These oases have historically existed as independent states or were controlled by many
        civilizations including China, the Mongols, the Tibetans and various Turkic polities. The Uyghurs gradually
        started to become Islamized in the 10th century and most Uyghurs identified as Muslims by the 16th century.
        Islam has since played an important role in Uyghur culture and identity.</p>

    <p>An estimated 80% of Xinjiang's Uyghurs still live in the Tarim Basin.[28] The rest of Xinjiang's Uyghurs mostly
        live in Ürümqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, which is located in the historical region of Dzungaria. The
        largest community of Uyghurs living in another region of China are the Uyghurs living in Taoyuan County, in
        north-central Hunan.[29] Significant diasporic communities of Uyghurs exist in other Turkic countries such as
        Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkey.[30] Smaller communities live in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Australia,
        Russia and Sweden.</p>
